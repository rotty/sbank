This is a Scheme binding for gobject-introspection[0], called sbank,
after pybank, a Python binding for gobject-introspection. However, the
idea here is to go for a even more lightweight binding:

- Don't wrap the whole of the girepository library; we only need a
  tiny bit of it:

  - lookup the typelib for a given namespace and name in the default
    repository, and return a pointer to the in-memory-structure (data
    member) of the typelib; lets call that the typelib-blob.

  - The rest can be figured out from that blob; we just need a way of
    destructuring the blob. Instead of letting the girepository
    library do this for us (and having to hand-code bindings to it),
    we extract the necessary information (basically struct offsets)
    from the gtypelib.h header.

- Do everything possible in Scheme. That should be basically
  everything, given a decent FFI. I'll first try my hand doing this
  for ikarus, but I'll try to keep the FFI-dependent part as small as
  possible to ease future ports.
