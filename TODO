* Missing features

** Bigger stuff

*** TODO Allow deriving from GObject classes

... and implementing interfaces as well.

** Smaller stuff

*** TODO Review codebase for uses of ~pointer?~

Pointers are not necessarily a disjunct type; in Ypsilon, for instance
they are just positive integers.

*** TODO Implement abstract classes

There should be no ~new*~ static method on abstract classes.

*** TODO Implement bitfield setters & getters

* Test suite

** TODO Extend test suite to cover all of "Everything"

* Efficiency

** TODO Write some benchmarks

What would be interesting is a benchmark justifying sbank's design of
"cutting out the middle man" (the "middle man" being
~libgirepository~). This design decision is based on the assumption
that calling out to C is quite a bit more expensive than parsing the
binary typelib data directly from Scheme. I expect the assumption to
hold for both Ikarus and Ypsilon, with Ikarus cashing in more on that
design.

** TODO "Compress" callouts by signature in `let-callouts' and `define-callouts'

This is a rather minor optimization, I guess.

* Usage examples

** TODO Complete the GTK+ demo
