* Core

** TODO Implement field setters

Getters should already work (modulo bitfields).

** TODO Implement ownership transfer

Full and nothing transfer should work, container-only transfer needs
still to be implemented.

** TODO Review codebase for uses of `pointer?'

Pointers are not necessarily a disjunct type; in Ypsilon, for instance
they are just positive integers.

* Test suite

** TODO Extend test suite to cover all of "Everything"

* Efficiency

** TODO Write some benchmarks
** TODO "Compress" callouts by signature in `let-callouts' and `define-callouts'

* Usage examples

** TODO Complete the GTK+ demo
** TODO Port some examples from libsoup
