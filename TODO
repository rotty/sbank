* Core

** TODO Implement field getters/setters
** TODO Implement ownership transfer

** TODO Provide a enum-lookup to g-value-{ref,set!} wherever possible

- To make this feasible, the find-typelib-enum-lookup must be moved
  outside of (sbank typelib base), so the caller doesn't have to be
  higher in the dependency tree than that. This way, (sbank gobject
  gvalue) could even directly use the lookup finder, without the
  caller having to provide it (which is kind of ugly anyway)

** TODO Implement support for flags

* Efficiency

** TODO Write some benchmarks
** TODO "Compress" callouts by signature in `let-callouts' and `define-callouts'

* Usage examples

** TODO Complete the GTK+ demo
** TODO Port some examples from libsoup
